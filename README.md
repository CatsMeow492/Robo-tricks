# Robo-tricks: Custom Robotics as a Service

## Vision
Democratizing robotics through AI-driven customization and lifecycle management. We're revolutionizing how businesses access and utilize robotic solutions by making custom robotics accessible, maintainable, and scalable.

## What We Do
Robo-tricks leverages advanced AI technology to design, build, and maintain custom robotic solutions based on specific use cases. Our platform:

- Uses a custom-trained RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model to design robots from standardized components
- Automatically generates optimal robot configurations based on high-level business requirements
- Provides end-to-end lifecycle management including maintenance and upgrades
- Delivers robots as a service with predictable subscription pricing

## How It Works

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Customers describe their use case and requirements
2. **AI Design**: Our RAG model generates optimal robot designs using our standardized component library
3. **Assembly & Training**: We build the robot and train it for the specific use case
4. **Deployment**: Robot is shipped to the customer ready to work
5. **Ongoing Support**: Continuous monitoring, maintenance, and upgrades

## Value Proposition

- **Cost-Effective**: No large upfront investment in robot development
- **Customized Solutions**: Robots designed specifically for your use case
- **Reduced Risk**: Full lifecycle management and support included
- **Future-Proof**: Regular upgrades and improvements
- **Scalable**: Easy to deploy additional units or upgrade capabilities
