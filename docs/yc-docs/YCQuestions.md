**Previous Applications/Pivots:**
This is our first YC application. The idea for Robo-tricks emerged from our experience deploying RAG models at the Department of Defense, where we observed how AI could transform complex technical processes. While we've worked on other AI/ML projects, this represents our first venture into robotics-as-a-service, combining our expertise in:
- RAG model deployment
- Systems integration
- User experience design
- Technical requirement analysis

The concept hasn't pivoted since inception in Q1 2025, though we've refined our approach based on:
1. Technical validation of the RAG model's capability to translate use cases into technical specifications
2. Feedback from potential customers about their automation pain points
3. Insights from robotics advisors about component standardization
4. Market research confirming the need for accessible robotics solutions

## Idea

**Why this idea? Domain expertise? Customer need?**
Our experience deploying RAG models at the Department of Defense gave us unique insights into AI's potential to solve complex technical challenges. As a software engineer with an electrical engineering background and robotics experience, I've seen how RAG models can effectively translate complex requirements into technical specifications. Dorian's expertise in RAG applications and media technology adds the crucial UX layer needed to make complex systems accessible.

The industrial robotics market's key problems align perfectly with our expertise:
